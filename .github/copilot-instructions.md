# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines
- Prioritize Razor Pages answers over Blazor or ASP.NET Core MVC for this project.
- Use product name 'WizVault' everywhere (title, navbar, footers, and headings) and add a small text subtitle 'by Wizrom Software' under the main brand in the header and footer. The subtitle should be smaller than the title and avoid large logo images that break layout.
- On the 'Parole' (Home/Index) page, replace 'WizVault' title and 'by Wizrom Software' subtitle with the menu name 'Parole' displayed as the page heading. Prefer minimal heading showing current menu context.
